## Featured Projects

### Project 1: Classification Modeling on Tabular Data

* Brief Description: Built and compared multiple classification models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) to predict a target variable on a tabular dataset. Utilized feature selection (ANOVA) and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) to optimize model performance, achieving a macro F1 score of up to 0.81. The project demonstrates expertise in data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
* Key Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression

### Project 2: Credit Score Classification

* Brief Description: Built and compared multiple neural network models to accurately classify credit scores, employing techniques like hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and class imbalance mitigation. Achieved up to 75% accuracy in predicting credit scores based on various financial and behavioral factors. Explored different architectures and optimized model performance for real-world application in credit risk assessment.
* Key Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Neural Networks, MLFN, SNN
