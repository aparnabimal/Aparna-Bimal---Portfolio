# Aparna Bimal - Portfolio

Hello, I am Aparna Bimal! I'm a data enthusiast who loves tackling complex challenges and uncovering hidden insights. Armed with a Master's in Business Analytics and a background in Computer Science Engineering, I leverage my expertise in machine learning, data visualization, and communication to transform raw data into strategic recommendations. I'm a highly adaptable and efficient professional who thrives in collaborative environments.

The principle of trusting more in the process than the outcome is something I have come to embrace dearly throughout my academic and professional life. I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning, and I'm excited to share my projects and experiences with you.

## Featured Projects

### Project 1: Classification Modeling on Tabular Data

* Brief Description: Built and compared multiple classification models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) to predict a target variable on a tabular dataset. Utilized feature selection (ANOVA) and hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) to optimize model performance, achieving a macro F1 score of up to 0.81. The project demonstrates expertise in data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
* Key Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression
